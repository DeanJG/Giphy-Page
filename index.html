        The idea would be to have dynamically created buttons, whose values are the same as the names
        assigned to them, which also serve as keywords to search through the giphy api.

        JS/HTML
        This would be done by creating some sort of array with the list of keywords i would use
        for said search, and then iterate over this array to create each of the buttons, with a text
        input for the user to manually create their own search keywords that would essentially 
        take the user's input and push it into the keyword array, with a function to re-render
        the keyword array, thus adding the user input keyword to the page of keyword buttons.

        HTML
        the display would just be an api query limit of 10 to keep the page relatively clutter-free,
        with a toggle function on each dynamically created gif div that serves to 'start' and 'stop'
        the gifs.

        each dynamically created gif would also have a setAttribute done on them to add the various
        entries into the 'dataset', such as still, or animated.
